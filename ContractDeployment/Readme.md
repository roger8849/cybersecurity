# Blockchain -  Proof of concept Smart Contracts 

Along this simple repository I've done a proof of concept about Smart contracts using blockchain. All the information here it's mocked and the tools used are meant to be tested in local environments. Toolset:

- (Ethereum wallet v3.4.0)[https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/etherwallet/releases/tag/v3.40.0]
- (Ganache)[https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache]
